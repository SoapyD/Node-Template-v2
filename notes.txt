-DONE -Limit the range to the maximum range of a gun
-DONE -Keep a list of potential unit shooting targets that can be referred back to later

-DONE -save the potential targets to the gamedata table
-DONE -generate blast markers
-DONE -generate barrier
-DONE -generate wounding
-DONE -Figure out in the timeline exactly where a bullet will die

-Full Check
    -DONE -Generate target paths for all units
    -DONE -When all units are readied up
        -DONE -tick through bullets, deciding what order they'll hit in, and what wounding occurs
        -DONE -figure out if a unit is dead in this step phase so when the next bullet is figured out, it'll then carry past any "dead units"

-Smart Check
    -Maybe instead of stopping a bullet entirely when it's path is checked, all unit stops are logged
    -Then pass a set number of wounding scores that can then be applied to any unit it hits
    -There would need to be a way for the server to figure out who's actually hit though


-DONE -liveMessage alert is spawning for a second or two, causing a stutter
-DONE -Grey out the offscene menu when a room is succesfully join or created then close it after the message bar is removed

-DONE -use the game template setup and connect to the socket using a guest login
-DONE -Move the pathfinder script to the server and load the MAP JSON file
-DONE -Strip down the unit class to completely seperate out any functions that can be carried out on the server with those those must be on the client side
    -DONE -Sprite generation and movement, CLIENT
    -DONE -setting actions, SERVER
    -DONE -path checking to show available spaces, SERVER
-DONE -Tie the marker to an actual user ID instead of just the first one



-DONE -Create a means of generating a path on the server then passing back a series of positions and angles for the sprite to follow
-DONE -Control the game state on the Server now its been seperated from the GameUI class

-DONE -Position a unit then generate possible positions for them to move in the server
    -run a loop x number of times a second then cancel it when it's no longer needed
    -return all possible movement position
-DONE -When a possible position is clicked on
    -recognise the click
    -generate path to that position then send it to the client
    -draw the client path
    -set a timer on the server that calculates which marker the unit should be on over x seconds then send that position to the client to align the client
    -make the unit interpolate along the given path
